# myGmpy2Build
gmpy2 library for x64 Anaconda Python

This repo provides instructions for building the Python gmpy2 library. The source code for gmpy2 is available at:

https://pypi.org/project/gmpy2/
https://github.com/aleaxit/gmpy

A functioning mingw-w64 compiler (http://http://mingw-w64.org) and the msys2 environment (https://www.msys2.org/) are necessary for being able to build the Windows binaries for the Python bigfloat library. This project depends on gmp, mpfr, mpc and possibly mpir (dependending on your configuration). A build script, gmpy2-bigfloat-build-v1.sh, is provided to make the process simpler.

The gmpy2 binaries for Python 3.8 are provided as a community service.
